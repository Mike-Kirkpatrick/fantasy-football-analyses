# Fantasy Football Analyses 2018

Web scrape our NFL Fantasy Football league and analyze multiple seasons of data.

# TO DO
- Make gantt chart for seasons participated
- Save final data sets
- Scatterplot of points for and points against
- For every plot, state which direction they want to see their name (top or bottom)

### Brief Introduction
- Reading is hard so I've used as few words as possible. 
- Time Period
- Rational for comparing last 5 years
- Welcome ideas for things to look at in the future
- This is the foundation for future reports - excitited to dig into our gameplay (or lack thereof)

### Where The Hell Did These Numbers Come From?

## Playoffs and Regular Season
Statistics for stuff that happens during the playoffs and the regular season.

### Max Points
Aaron has the highest score of all time. Fun fact is that he got this score during the championship game in our first season.

### Min Points
Points are good, so having few points is bad. This plot is the lowest score you've ever scored. Hopefully your name is towards the top of this chart.

### Trades
Yeah, we don't trade...ever. Most people have never traded. We should become more trusting of each other.

### Transactions
Some of you are extremely loyal to your draft picks and some of you have an entirely new team by the end of the season. Alex basically has a new team every week. Given that there are 16 weeks in the regular season, Aaron changes out roughly one player per week.

The last 5 seasons look very similar to all seasons. It appears that we have our own strategy and we stick to it.

## Playoffs
Statistics for stuff that happens during the playoffs.

### Playoff Appearances
Alex and Nathan have made it to the playoffs 2 out of 2 times, which is impressive. However, Mike Thomas has made it to the playoffs 6 out of 7 times which is very impressive.

### Playoff Champions
AJ and Kameron have won twice. Brian, Sam, Aaron and myself have won once.

## Regular Season
Statistics for stuff that happens during the regular season.

### Average Points Against
These are the points that are scored against you. Looking at all seasons, it's pretty consistent for each coach.

However, looking at the last 5 seasons, it's rather suspicious that our commisioner is at the bottom of this list...

### Average Points For
These are the points that you score each week. The distribution is a little more spread out than Points Against. Kameron proudly sits atop the list.

Looking at the last 5 seasons, it appears that the wealth-gap has widened. The rich have gotten richer and the poor have gotten poorer #Trump2020

### Average Weekly Rank
Each week, there are 12 teams that play in 6 matchups. Instead of looking at the results of the matchups, this is a ranking of all 12 teams from highest score (#1) to lowest score (#12) for the given week. I then took the average across all weeks/seasons. It's similar to Average Points For, except that this measure is robust to bye weeks. Hopefully you find your name towards the top of this list.
![Alt text](./plots/reg_season_avg_weekly_rank.png?raw=true)

Looking at the last 5 seasons, we see a similar trend: certain players are trending upwards while others are slowly sinking.
